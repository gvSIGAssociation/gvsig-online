			This option can take one of the following values:

			* `-string api` - Selection can only be performed via the API
			* `-string single` - Only a single item can be selected, any other selected items will be automatically deselected when a new item is selected
			* `-string multi` - Multiple items can be selected. Selection is performed by simply clicking on the items to be selected
			* `-string os` - _Operating System_ (OS) style selection. This is the most comprehensive option and provides complex behaviours such as ctrl/cmd clicking to select / deselect individual items, shift clicking to select ranges and an unmodified click to select a single item.

	<description>
		Select provides a number of different built in ways that an end user can interact with the selection of items in the table, which is controlled by this parameter (and `s-api select.style()` after initialisation).

		The default mode of operation is based on the selection of files in modern operating systems with the ctrl/cmd and shift keys can be user to provide complex operations.

		Note that while the `-string api` option disables item selection via Select's built in event handler, it is quote possible to use the API to still provide the end user with the ability to select / deselect items based on your own event handlers.
